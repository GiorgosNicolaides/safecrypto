When systems lack proper integrity checks, attackers can manipulate data undetected, leading to corrupted files, unauthorized modifications, or malicious code insertion.  
Missing support for integrity verification (CWE-353) means no mechanism exists to confirm data hasnâ€™t been tampered with.  
Even if a check is present, improperly validating the integrity value (CWE-354) can allow altered data to pass as legitimate.  
Hardware components that fail to zeroize registers correctly (CWE-1239) leave residual sensitive data accessible after use.  
Using cryptographic hashes or digital signatures along with strict validation is essential to ensure data integrity at every stage.
